Public facing documents associated with Fides Exchange and Fides Exchange Token (FIDES).

Fides Exchange operated from July 2019 until December 2022 and offered true markets which were not artificially inflated. The exchange remained the fastest trading platform available while providing exceptional user support. We were self-funded and remained operational with extremely limited investor engagement; as a result, we closed operations in December 2022.

During our time of operation, standard exchanges fell to the alure of DeFi projects which, like many crypto projects, were simple means of hype driven schemes which provided little to no agency for the crypto economy save the continued investment and ultimate transfer of those funds to less than reputable people. We were told by many investors that emphasis was now on DeFi even though there was little utility and purpose to support the attention - as is typical with most new crypto fads, there have been many extremely well-funded projects that have since failed, catastrophically.

The remaining founders of Fides Exchange remains hopeful that sometime in the future, we may again operate an exchange which is more concerned with users and the crypto economy.
